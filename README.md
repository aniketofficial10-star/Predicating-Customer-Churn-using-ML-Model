# Predicating-Customer-Churn-using-ML-Model
Business objective: It's a subscription based


**To build this prediction model, we have analyzed 4 different datasets.**
1. Customer.csv: Consist of customer info, like name, age, gender, region, etc.
2. Churn.csv: Tells us which customer has actually left and when the left.
3. Subscription.csv: Start and End date and Type of subscription.
4. Transaction.csv: How much money customer has spent or received (refund) over the time.


**Approached/Methodology:**
Step 1: Combine or merge all these datasets
Step 2: Feature Engineering
